# Standard Git Procedures

The codebase for all things software for Rice Eclipse is on GitHub ([https://github.com/rice-eclipse](https://github.com/rice-eclipse)). This document contains all relevant procedures and information on how to appropriately use Git version control for our software development.

We will also be using Trello to keep track of specific tasks that we come up with: [https://trello.com/invite/b/tpdsNmC9/7acbbe8259b702c2eabc25696d5fbfc5/rustfet](https://trello.com/invite/b/tpdsNmC9/7acbbe8259b702c2eabc25696d5fbfc5/rustfet)
